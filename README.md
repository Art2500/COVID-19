## A.Abstract    

Analyses and plots were formed from working datasets to ascertain whether respiratory ailments had a high correlation with COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations. Neither case showed significant enough correlation to prove this thesis 

## B.Introduction  
Incidents of COVID-19 have obviously grown as the year goes on and more data in compiled. The goal of this research project is to better understand what raises one's chances of contracting the disease and if those factors make one more likely to die. When dealing with viruses many factors come into play when in comes to the contraction of the disease.Varibles like genetics, environmental factors,predipostion to the disease, and immune system all play roles. I've chosen some factors I feel are acutely related to the disease to see how if they correlate with incidence of the disease.  


## C.Hypothesis: Respiratory issues correlate with COVID 19 rates.    

My hypothesis is that of the patients who have been hospitalized from COVID-19 and those who have died from it, that there will be higher correlation with respiratory illnesses than other underlying conditions.   

## D.Datasets used  

Provisional Death Counts from CDC: https://healthdata.gov/dataset/provisional-death-counts-coronavirus-disease-covid-19

Conditions contributing to deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), by age group and state, United States.: https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Conditions-contributing-to-deaths-involving-corona/hk9y-quqm


Selected Underlying Medical Conditions of COVID-19-associated Hospitalizations from the COVID-NET Network: https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19_5.html

## E.Descrption of analyses  

Different plots and table were made from the datasets and further analyzed to ascertain correlation. An ANOVA analysis was also done for this reason.  


## F.Conclusions  

While incidents of respiratory ailments were high among deaths I did not find enough data to significantly reject my null hypothesis. My data does show that a high percentage of COVID-19 deaths are comorbid with pneumonia. In the case of hospitalizations the most like underlying conditions were obesity and hypertension. For further analysis I would need to gather more data from more countries as the bulk of my data came from America. Americans may skew some of the numbers as obesity and hypertension are large scale American issues.
