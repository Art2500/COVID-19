## A.Abstract (tl;dr)  
## B.Introduction  
Incidents of COVID-19 have obviously grown as the year goes on and more data in compiled. The goal of this research project is to better understand what raises one's chances of contracting the disease. When dealing with viruses many factors come into play when in comes to the contraction of the disease.Varibles like genetics, environmental factors,predipostion to the disease, and immune system all play roles. I've chosen some factors I feel are acutely related to the disease to see how if they correlate with incidence of the disease.
## C.Hypothesis: Respiratory issues correlate with COVID 19 rates.  
My hypothesis is simple. Ailing health and pre-existing conditions increase occurance of COVID COVID-19.
